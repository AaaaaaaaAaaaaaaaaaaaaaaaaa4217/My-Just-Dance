# My Just Dance
  Copy of Just Dance created with Google MediaPipe.
  The project is written in python using the cv2 and mediapipe libraries.
  While working on this project, I learned how to work with mediapipe and cv2. In the future, I will port the project to unity for VR (Virtual Reality), and make it a full-fledged social network.
